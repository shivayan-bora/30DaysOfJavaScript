    *  Attribute Selector:
        You can select elements in JavaScript the same way you can use an attribute selector to select elements in CSS. You can use a querySelector for that.
    * `audio.currentTime = 0`: To rewind the audio to the start.
    * If an audio element is playing, it won't play again until it finishes playing.
    * You can listen to transition events. i.e. if an element is animating. In this case, the propertyName of the event is `transform`.
